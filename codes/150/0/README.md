# 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given a JSON file that represents a hierarchical tree structure.
Each node in the tree can have either:

a list of leaves, or
a list of branches (which are themselves nodes in the same format).

Write a program to extract all the leaf elements from this nested structure and store them in a list.
